**How this folder should be structured**  
- `meccaniche/` is the folder containing only logos and images related to game jam mechanics. Files are named as the mechanics they represent  
- `banner.png/.jpg./.psd` is the banner related to the game jam
- `logo.png/.jpg/.psd` is the logo related to the game jam. It is a smaller version of the banner
- `project_files/` is the folder containing Godot Engine Project files that shall be used for Game Jam subscriptions (ready-to-use scenes, splashscreens, shaders, scripts, etc..)
